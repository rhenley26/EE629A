This project will require a webcam or integrated laptop camera, several thirdparty libraries, and a linux-based operating system. 
I personally used Ubuntu to build and run this program, but I will point out that Windows Subsystems for Linux will most likely
NOT work for this project due to some interal permissions issues with camera access.
